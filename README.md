# Progressive-Budget

As an avid traveller, I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

This app was developed to help keep record of transactions even when there is no internet connection. If a transaction is entered while there is no internet connection, the information is saved in the cache and the information is then sent to the database once there is internet connection.

All you need to use this app is a web browser.
